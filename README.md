# Javascript Project 

We create our own code in this quoteGEnerator.js.

## About this test

It is pretty tough test. I just make some codes and put some comments to help us to understand much better. It is quite hard to understand but try to read the comments and you will get it clearly

## My interpretation about this test

Always try to solve problem and it is nice to ask the teacher for help much rather than stay and do nothing.

## This is the first part of this test

## This is the second part of this test

//1. use prompt to ask the user how many times we want to generate a random quote
//2. check if the prompt give us something between 1 and 5
//3. we're going to use a loop somewhere, and it's going to last the number of times that the user entered in the prompt!
//4. refactor our code into a function, and put the function call inside the loop
//4.1 generate random numbers
//4.2 show the generated quotes

## About this tips

This tips make this test easier. However, we need to read carefully and try to remember the instructions.
